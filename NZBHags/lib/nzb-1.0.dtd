<!--
    This is the NZB 1.0 DTD; a simple XML format for describing
    collections of one or more files located on Usenet.

    Namespace = http://www.newzbin.com/2003/nzb

    This DTD is identified by the PUBLIC and SYSTEM identifiers:

      PUBLIC "-//newzBin//DTD NZB 1.0//EN"
      SYSTEM "http://www.newzbin.com/DTD/nzb/nzb-1.0.dtd"

    Clients are expected to handle extensions to this specification.
    If you're not parsing it with a reasonable XML parser and coping
    with elements and attributes your client doesn't know about, well,
    your client is broken.
